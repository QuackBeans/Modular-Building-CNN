# Information

This is a Convolutional Neural Network built for identifying different types of modular buildings and cabins based on their images.
I started this project to aid with automating repetitive databasing tasks at my previous job.

The images are all sourced from modular building provider's websites, and tagged according to the provider's description.
The images of course take up quite a bit of space, so i've zipped them and uploaded them separately. Just drop them in to the main directory.
